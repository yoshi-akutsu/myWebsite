    <h3 class="pic">The Realities of College Admissions and Funding</h3>
		<p>In 2017, 47,782 people applied to Ohio State. 48% were admitted. Out of those 22,935 people that were admitted only 31% were yielded. That means that only 31% of the 22,935 admitted students ended up going to Ohio State. That’s 7,110. Almost 48,000 applied
			to Ohio State in 2017 but only about 7,000 actually end up going there.</p>
		<p>The main takeaway we can get from the above example is simply: Very few students who apply to schools like Ohio State actually end up attending. Let’s look at some comparable schools:</p>
		<table class="table">
			<thead>
  		<tr>
    		<th scope="col">School</th>
    		<th scope="col">Number of Applicants</th>
    		<th scope="col">Percent Admitted</th>
				<th scope="col">Percent Yielded</th>
  		</tr>
		</thead>
		<tbody>
  		<tr>
    		<th scope="row">Indiana University</th>
    		<td>41,939</td>
    		<td>76%</td>
				<td>25%</td>
  		</tr>
			<tr>
    		<th scope="row">University of Cincinatti</th>
    		<td>21,593</td>
    		<td>76%</td>
				<td>33%</td>
  		</tr>
			<tr>
    		<th scope="row">Case Western Reserve University</th>
    		<td>25,380</td>
    		<td>33%</td>
				<td>16%</td>
  		</tr>
			<tr>
    		<th scope="row">Purdue University</th>
    		<td>49,354</td>
    		<td>57%</td>
				<td>27%</td>
  		</tr>
		</tbody>
		</table>
		<p>Look at those yield numbers. Why are these schools having such a hard time getting students to actually attend once they’ve been accepted? It’s clear that the majority of admitted students are choosing another school. In fact, a large number of Ohio students probably applied to all of the above schools. What this says is that these colleges are competing for students to attend. They want the best and brightest entering class, but they have limited power to achieve that. One way they do achieve that, however, is by offering attractive students (relative to the school) good financial aid packages. Let’s take a look at a different set of schools:
		</p>
		<table class="table">
			<thead>
  		<tr>
    		<th scope="col">School</th>
    		<th scope="col">Number of Applicants</th>
    		<th scope="col">Percent Admitted</th>
				<th scope="col">Percent Yielded</th>
  		</tr>
		</thead>
		<tbody>
  		<tr>
    		<th scope="row">Harvard University</th>
    		<td>39,506</td>
    		<td>5%</td>
				<td>83%</td>
  		</tr>
			<tr>
    		<th scope="row">University of Pennsylvania</th>
    		<td>40,413</td>
    		<td>9%</td>
				<td>65%</td>
  		</tr>
			<tr>
    		<th scope="row">Duke University</th>
    		<td>33,077</td>
    		<td>10%</td>
				<td>54%</td>
  		</tr>
			<tr>
    		<th scope="row">University of Michigan</th>
    		<td>59,886</td>
    		<td>27%</td>
				<td>43%</td>
  		</tr>
		</tbody>
		</table>
		<p>What do the above schools have in common? High(er) yield numbers and household names. Almost anyone, nationwide, knows of these schools, and knows that they are good. People are falling over themselves to attend these schools, even if they have to pay the $45,000+ annual cost of attendance. These schools are not competing as much financially to get students to attend. Some schools will compete financially to get strong students to attend, while others don’t have to. Our best strategy for applying to college comes from an understanding of the current reality of college admissions and funding. This means applying to a variety of schools, which encourages financial competition, but also doesn’t close the door on some of the best programs for us.
		</p>
		<h3 class="pic">The Strategy</h3>
		<p>Everyone wants to go to a school that is a good fit. Defining that can help us start talking about  college application strategy. Here are four factors to consider when making a choice about college:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Quality of Program</li>
			<li>Lifestyle Fit Factors</li>
			<li>Industry Name-recognition</li>
			<li>Finances</li>
		</ul>
		<p>A quality program is at the cornerstone of any good college choice. If we don’t know what we want out of a school academically, we cannot make an educated choice about applying to that school. Basically, ask yourself this: is the school I am applying to good at my desired major? Schools are good at some majors, but not all of them, even schools like Duke and Michigan. That said, even the best program won’t set up a miserable student for success. Lifestyle fit factors are also very important for student success. If we are not comfortable at school, it will hinder our success.
		</p>
		<p>When it comes to name-recognition, instead of thinking about Ivy League schools or other famous universities, we should think about name-recognition from the point of view of the industry that hires college graduates. Employer name recognition is what we really need to get a solid job after college; household name recognition is not. While we must pay a premium for household names, we don’t always have to for employer name recognition.
		</p>
		<p>Finances is the last part. Good financial deals come from schools vying for you to attend their institution. Remember, schools want the best and brightest entering class, but they have limited power to achieve that. We need to apply to schools that want to compete for us to attend, that is schools where we are above the average student profile. Lastly, don’t forget that grades and test scores aren’t the only things about us that will make colleges us want to compete for us. There are numerous other factors that can make us appealing to colleges that are beyond the scope of this strategy. If we apply to a variety of schools that all have a quality program, lifestyle fit, and industry name-recognition, we are setting ourselves up for a solid investment in college.
		</p>
		<p>Here is how we define that variety:</p>
		<h4>Regional Programs: </h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Solid programs with attractive features that are recognized by employers in the region where they are located (i.e. Ohio, the Midwest, South, East Coast and so on).
			</li>
			<li>Where the student is above the average student in terms of test scores and GPA. This encourages these colleges to compete financially for our attendance.</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>National Programs: </h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Solid programs with attractive features that are recognized by employers nationwide.
			</li>
			<li>Where the student is comparable to the average student in terms of test scores and GPA. This offers flexibility for these colleges to compete financially for our attendance if we happen to be of interest to them. </li>
		</ul>

		<h4>Reach Programs: </h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Solid programs with attractive features that are recognized for that by employers nationwide. </li>
			<li>Where attending the program could be difficult for one or more of the following reasons:
				<ul>
				<li>Admissions</li>
				<li>Finances</li>
				<li>Distance</li>
			</ul></li>
		</ul>
		<p>Also known as dream schools, we say that it is always worth a shot at your dreams, but do understand the constraints around actually attending and only apply to one or two.
		</p>
		<p>If we apply to 2-3 regional programs, 2-3 national programs, and 1-2 reach programs, we are applying widely enough to best take advantage of the uncertainty of college admissions and financing. At the same time, we are limiting the total number of schools we are applying to so that we are not overextending ourselves, so we are only applying to schools with purpose.
		</p>
		<p>If each school has quality of program, lifestyle fit, and industry name-recognition, we know that no matter what, we will attend a school that will set us up for a solid job after college. We have solid regional programs that are highly likely to be good financial deals. At the same time, it allows for the lower chance that a national or reach program will try to compete for us. Ultimately, diverse options allows us to actually make a decision based on our values rather than allowing the whims of 2 or 3 schools we happened to apply to dictate our futures.
